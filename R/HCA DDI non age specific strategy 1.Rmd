## Model description for Strategy 1 pill only- 
- This model does not consider a post-imb state and assumes that women can only enter the imb state once and continue in that state (constantly).
- Does not consider age specific probabilities for birth, ia, sa, and ep

## Need to do univariate sensitivity analysis 
eg 1. p_vte 0.0000833326 (0.00005-0.00010)
